# Writing

- Try to use the active voice whenever possible.
- Keep in mind your style:
  - **Be concise**. Understand the topic you're writing about. Use simple words and sentences. Put the most important things first. Never use a long word when a short one will do.
  - **Be Useful**. Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?
  - **Be specific**. Avoid vague language (remove qualifiers). Cut the fluff. Delete unnecessary words. Say what you mean. Make positive statements about reality.
  - **Be consistent**.
  - **Add rhythm**. Vary the sentence length to break the monotony.
- [Style is a small part of writing well. Most of writing is thinking clearly.](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro) The act of simply putting a thought into words makes it immediately obvious to you if you really understand it or not, and if not, where your blind spots are.
- Have solid schemas. List the points you want to make in a logical order. This allows you to remove the clutter and avoid confusion:
  - Define a clear thesis.
  - Support your thesis with arguments.
  - Declare and reject the antithesis.
  - Conclusions.
- Human beings are wired to respond to storytelling. A story arc is a way to structure ideas to tap into this response, typically by describing a change in the world.
- Use positive language rather than negative language.
- Write in a conversational tone.
- Use second-person and describe actions to a user. Technical content talks to users when support agents can't.
- Divide things into small chunks.
- If you have multiple points in a text, number them to make replies easier.
- Don't fully think through your ideas before writing. It's inefficient. The best way to think is by writing. It compels your brain to connect the dots. [Write whatever helps you think better](https://twitter.com/eugeneyan/status/1256828197410201601). Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can't write and edit.
- You can use tools like [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) or [Ludwig](https://ludwig.guru/) to improve.
