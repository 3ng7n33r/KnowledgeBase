# Talking

- Smile and look at the eyes.
- Remove filler words.
- Speak with sincerity and passion.
- Speak [slow](https://sive.rs/slow) and naturally.
  - Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s a knee-jerk emotional response to something in your past.
- Learn to **listen**.
  - Become interested in other people. Encourage others to talk about themselves. The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested.
  - Being able to listen well is a superpower. Listening is difficult because it involves suppressing your ego long enough to consider what is being said before you respond.
  - Forget your agenda. Don't have internal monologue.
  - Avoid trying to respond immediately and allow the other person time to finish speaking.
  - Don't answer your phone while speaking with someone in real life. If the real life conversation starts, has precedence over the asynchronous ones.
  - While listening to someone sharing a problem keep asking them "Is there more?", until there is no more.
  - Connect with people, don't perform for them.
- Aim to make liberal use of the _you_ pronoun.
- No matter how correct you are, you won't get anywhere by making the other person feel stupid. Not being annoying is more important than being smart. Aim to make friends. [Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/).
- Ask for help instead of demanding it.
- Favor interrogative-led questions over leading questions. A leading question attempts to get the listener to agree or disagree with a premise you feed to them. An interrogative-led question often begins with the words: who; where; what; when; why. "Did you like the movie?" vs "What did you think about the movie?".
- Make [interesting questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_iFxFt9lh1i0mxKRIhOSd2e8X1LNvxnihbChKXhyOc/mobilebasic) to know people better. Use FORD (Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams as fallback topics.
