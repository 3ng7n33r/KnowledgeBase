# Communications

> To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others — Tony Robbins

Communication is the science of transmitting knowledge to other humans. It goes by many names: debate, negotiation, discussion, education, and many more. Communication is a skill that is learnable.

**The person who tells the most compelling story wins**. Not the best idea. Just the story that catches people's attention and gets them to nod their heads. Tell people what they want to hear and you can be wrong indefinitely without penalty.

You become an average of the people you spend the most time with. Choose wisely!

## Feedback

Feedback is the core of personal and professional growth. Feedback help us being better at what we do establishing clear communications and expectations.

All feedback is good feedback. If you agree with it, it tells you something about yourself which you can to work on correcting. If you don't agree with it, it tells you that there is an incorrect perception about you in the other persons mind. You can also work on correcting that. When someone tells you something is wrong, they're almost always right. When someone tells you how to fix it, they're almost always wrong.

### Taking Feedback

- Use the word advice instead of feedback to get more results.
- The only constant in the world is change. Be open to it and accept it with a smile.
- Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.
- Be mindful. Develop meta-awareness around the areas that you received feedback.
  - Look for opportunities to _stop doing_ or _start doing_ critiqued behaviors.

#### Technical Feedback

- You are not your work \(code, design, ...\).
- No matter how much you know about something, someone else will always know more.
- Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.
- True authority stems from knowledge, not from position.
- Critique code instead of people — be kind to the coder, not to the code.
- Focus on [Empathy](http://bravenewgeek.com/engineering-empathy/).

### Giving Feedback

- Feedback needs to be informal, frequent, and done authentically.
- Challenge ideas not people. Address behavior, but don't label people.
- Prepare. What do you value in someone? Where do you think are their biggest opportunities to improve?
- Keep the feedback actionable, specific, and kind.
- Imagine what things feel like from the other perspective.
- How to compose a successful critical commentary \(_from_ [_Daniel Dennett_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett)\):
  - You should attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, _"Thanks, I wish I'd thought of putting it that way"_.
  - You should list any points of agreement \(if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement\).
  - You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
  - Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.

## Resolving Disagreement

A few assumptions are required to have a successfully disagreement:

- Epistemic humility. "It's possible that I might be the one who's wrong, here".
- Good faith. An assumption that people believe things for causal reasons. Assume good intentions.
- Confidence in the existence of objective truth or a better position.
- Curiosity and/or a desire to uncover truth.
- As much data as possible to backup claims.

[Double crux]((https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement)) is great framework based on the previous assumptions.

One of the first thing to focus is narrowing the scope of the discussion. Find common ground. Ask "What would need to be true for you to...". Define terms to avoid getting lost in semantic confusions that miss the real point. Find specific test cases. Wherever possible, try to think in terms of actions rather than beliefs—it's easier to evaluate arguments like "we should do X before Y" than it is to converge on "X is better than Y".

Don't focus on proving yourself right, instead of focus on getting the best outcome.
Keep the conversation simple and summarize the conversation during the discussion.

### Blogging

- Writing is Thinking. Writing things down helps clarifying ideas. One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else. [Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html).
- Expect 80% of the ideas in an post to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong.
- To decide if your idea is worth writing about, [ask these questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/22/how-do-you-write-blog-posts/):
  - Would this have helped me a year ago?
  - Would this have helped me last week?
  - Do you think this would be interesting to at least like 2 other people?
- [You are best positioned to help people one step behind you](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045). The material is still fresh in your mind. Many experts have forgotten what it was like to be a beginner and have forgotten why the topic is hard to understand when you first hear it. The context of your particular background, your particular style, and your knowledge level will give a different twist to what you're writing about.
- [Share unoriginal ideas](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/). Your own ideas mostly seem trivial to you because you have the right concept structures in place to support them. You wouldn't come up with these ideas otherwise.
- Start with Why. Start with a question. Write the first flawed answer that comes to mind. Write the first question or objection that comes to mind from that answer. Write the first response that comes to mind from that, ...
- [Writing creates a cache](https://twitter.com/eugeneyan/status/1256828203840073728). The cache (i.e., documents) scales data availability. people can access the cache instead of going to you.
- For long-form content, the [diamond model](https://dropbox.design/article/mental-models-for-designers) works great for putting a structure around your main idea.
  1. Attention: Start with a story, statistic, or something similar
  1. Main topic: Briefly introduce the main topic you'll cover
  1. Previews: Give quick previews of your subtopics
  1. Subtopics: Go into depth with your subtopics
  1. Summaries: Recap your subtopics
  1. Conclusion: Paint an ideal vision of the future
  1. Call to action: Invite your audience to act or make a decision
- For [short-form content](https://sivers.org/7):
  1. Write all your thoughts on a subject.
  1. Argue against those ideas.
  1. Explore different angles.
  1. Leave it for a few days or years, then repeat those steps.
  1. Hate how messy these thoughts have become.
  1. Reduce them to a tiny outline of the key points.
  1. Post the outline. Trash the rest.
- Reading is the inhale, writing is the exhale. Breathe.
- The more you create, the more ideas come yo you to continue creating. That's the creativity feedback loop.
