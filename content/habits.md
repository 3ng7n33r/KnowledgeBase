# Habits

[We, humans, are basically habit machines](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1059504529111158784). We form habits. We run on those habits all day long. Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. How we spend your days is how you spend your life.

Habits can be great because they help us get tasks done efficiently without having to spend willpower on them all the time. The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it ([ego depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion)). Habits will keep the frontal cortex free to solve other problems.

They can also cause addictions and be harmful for us. It's important to be aware of your habits and know how to break habits and know how to make habits. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Make small habits that push you forward, little by little, and make them [compound](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp). Remember, there are [no hacks](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/useful-hacks/) in life!

Helpful steps for building habits:

- **Build a routine**. Set a specific, repeating time when you will do the thing in your calendar. Keep that slot clear, always. Never let something interrupt this task. Shape the environment to support your routine and habits. Make it easy to start and make it hard or impossible to not do it. Replace self-control with planning and proper environment (uninstalling a game makes removes a future decision to play it). You can also **stack habits**. Connect the habit that doesn't appear that much to you to what you strongly like. Then you'll be doing it for what you like.

- **Learn to say no**. If someone wants you to do something else during this time slot, say no, and tell them why.
- **Never break the routine**. Breaking it once makes it much easier to break the next scheduled time. Instead think about the smallest thing you can perform and make it your goal for the day. If you do break it, feel bad about it and get back on the horse as fast as you can. Use forcing functions to your advantage. A forcing function is any task, activity or event that forces you to take action and produce a result. Have a bias toward taking action. No lazy deferring. When itâ€™s habit time, it should require more willpower to break the habit than to keep going. [Become a mindless robot and don't think twice](https://tiffanymatthe.com/not-thinking).
  - Make the decision in advance. E.g. the two-minute rule. Where you decide that for anything that takes less than two minutes, you do it. No thinking, no arguing, just swift action. Another method is planning out your days in advance. Then when the time comes, you can mindlessly follow the schedule you have made for yourself.
- **Use the power of accountability to reinforce the routine**. If you can find someone who will hold you accountable, do it. Someone who does the routine with you, or a coach who will call you out if you make excuses. Whatever you value, hang around people that are better at it than you are.
- **One thing at a time**. Don't build a big routine of 15 tasks at once. Ease into it one habit at a time. Changing one at a time routine allows you to isolate the benefits. Remove related bad habits at the same time.
- **Don't overload yourself**. Leave time in your schedule for play. If it gets to be too much, decide which one you will drop permanently to make rooms for the rest.

Cognitive inertia is the reason that changing our habits can be difficult. The default is always the path of least resistance, which is easy to accept and harder to question. The important thing about inertia is that it is only the initial push that is difficult. After that, progress tends to be smoother.

## TAPs

Turn vague goals into trigger-action plans (TAPs). **If X then Y**. That works because they help us notice situations where we could carry out our intentions. They force us to turn vague and ambiguous goals into more specific ones. A good TAP fulfills three requirements:

- **The trigger is clear**. The _when_ part is a specific, visible thing that's easy to notice.
- **The trigger is consistent**. The action is something that you'll always want to do when the trigger is fulfilled.
- **The TAP furthers your goals**.

That's a system. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

## Themes

To better accomplish positive life change, [give yourself a theme](https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE). A theme will be easy to follow and will impact your daily actions. Without knowing where you want to go you just wonder. Resolutions give us the feeling of failure, themes gives us chances to apply them. A good theme can't fail. Just having a theme in your mind will change the way you think. You'll notice paths that weren't there before. Broad themes gives flexibility. Pick a broad directional idea that resonates with you and run with it. Themes can be as long or short as you need. These are some theme ideas:

- Order
- Simplicity
- Novelty
- Experiments
- Joy
- Health
- Finances
- Discipline
- Growth
- People
- Knowledge
- Nature
- Reflection
- Iteration
- Attention

## Routine

A way to keep yourself on track with your habits is to have a morning routine.

1. Rules. Remind yourself on the current set of rules, constrains, various addictions, time-draining things. E.g. limit social media, do some stretching, ...
2. Gratitude. Visualize and meditate on the idea that you might die today.
3. Long-term goals and short-term goals. Review big goals that you would like to achieve in the next years and the short term goals that lead to them that you can act on.
4. Visualize the day. Visualize yourself going through the day challenges and wins.
5. Review your core [values](values.md).
