# Ideas

A few personal random ideas.

## Key Properties of Ideas

- Timeless.
- No replication costs.
- Creates win-win situations.
- Network effects.

## Interesting Areas

- Data
- Governance
- Open Source
- Communities
- Education
- Science (biology, astrophysics, ...)
- Energy

## Awesome Game

- Modular Approach. The idea is to have a main character and multiple shards to play. Each shard could implement a different ruleset or genre.
- The modularity could also be implemented in the graphic side. You can choose the graphics pack you like just like another cosmetic.
- Player Driven Economy. Everything is made by players and traded for real life currency. The developers only get a fee for each trade. This makes the game fully F2P but also supports the developers.
- Companion Apps. Some tasks like trading or planning could be done from a mobile device.
- Systems \(items, skills, monsters, ...\) could be affected by evolutionary processes.
  - Merging two skills could produce a new one \(inheriting properties and perhaps with a small mutation\)
  - Monsters will develop resistance against what's killing them.
  - Quests rewards will also change dynamically.
- Players can vote for the next patch changes with ingame money. This way developers gets feedback on what's important.
- Could have a GPS RPG extension. Locations in the real world would be named similarly to the real place but with a twist given by a Neural Network.
- Factions can tace control of a region and build new things there.

## Unconventional Changelogs

- What if each city or town had a changelog? What changed in the last _release_? Did it change a street direction or opened a new commerce?
- What if stores had a changelog? That'd mean price history for each product and also new products would be easier to find.

## Fake Currencies

- A chores app where kids could earn a currency. This could be traded for rewards like going to the cinema or getting a new PC game.

## Open Data

> Open Data should be easily accessible and free. Imagine a decentralized, distributed platform where people collaborated on dataset the same way they collaborate on code.

- A protocol that makes possible adding, curating and sharing datasets.
- The main abstractions are `datasets` and `relations`. Both can be updated, forked and discussed like git repositories.
- Permissionless. People should be able to add new dataset or relation. The main ones will be curated by the community.
- Built on top of a distributed file system (IPFS, ...) and with incentives to increase collaboration (cryptocurrency, bounties, and other forms of open source funding).
- People could access the data with a simple CLI (`./opendata get "user/dataset:version")` or HTTPS endpoint (`opendata.com/user/dataset:version`).
- Declarative way of defining the dataset schema and other properties as well as the relations.
- Datasets should also be exposed in other places like Google Dataset Search.

### Open Knowledge

- Research.
  - Each publication is a repository, where people can contribute to make corrections.
- Distillation. Deeply digesting ideas, and putting them together into a framework of thinking.
  - Made by a small number of people with a strong vision and a deep investment in the article.
- Publication.
  - Should have different resolutions. E.g: Blog post for the general public, article for the scientific community, paper for the raw idea.

## Personal Knowledge Base

A tool and framework to manage knowledge. This will allow compound learning and make it easier to discover new abstractions or connections between concepts. These are the key properties of my ideal PKB (could replace this handbook):

- Simple, Open Source and multiplatform. Works offline and has a backup mechanism similar to git.
- Focus on capturing ideas and content as fast as possible.
- Should be managed as a graph:
  - Nodes are notes or smaller graphs. Notes should be atomic, concept-oriented and densely linked.
  - Bidirectional links connecting nodes.
  - Nodes could have several parents (concepts).
  - Users can remix and connect ideas in multiple overlapping hierarchies.
- [Each concept could be linked to external content (video, book, audio)](https://www.notion.so/Models-bb0f4bfd3cd140b3a00cd955e61003f9).
  - Content should have tags (related concepts)
- Can be made public.
- Personal Knowledge bases can be personal [ontologies with similar core components (individuals, classes, attributes, relations, ...)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_components).

Instead of building the tool, we can start with a standard protocol and let other tools (Roam, Notion, Obsidian) use that.

## City Discovery

- Create an activity similar to a gymkhana mixed with escape room. Players have to solve riddles and puzzles while learning about the city and its history.
- There might be digital and real life puzzles.
- Clues might be scattered across many checkpoints with actors as "NPC"s to guide the players.

## Social Network Improvements

- [Federate and open source current networks](computer-science/decentralization.md##federated-networks) to improve communities.
  - [The protocol should evolve differently for each community](https://youtu.be/P-2P3MSZrBM?t=5953). Communities will mix and match protocols (rules, monetization, rewarding, actions, governance, ...) to make the protocol fit their network.
- We need a social network that does not cause divisiveness and negativity that is currently the natural by-product of optimizing for greater engagement.
- How can the network incentivize healthy conversations and encourage nuanced discussions?
