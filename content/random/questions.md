# Open Questions

Some questions which I'm intrigued about and haven't researched enough to add their own entry on this handbook. Inspired by [Gwern Questions](https://www.gwern.net/Questions), [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/questions) and [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/personal/research-ideas/).

- [What is a good approach to effective education?](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mMKKsbxGiNirGjsA9/effective-children-education).
  - Would it be better if we grouped kids by skill level instead of age?
  - [What's the best way of teaching kids how to think?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24638756)
- [Are nootropics useful?](https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics)
