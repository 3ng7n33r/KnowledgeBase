# Intro

Hi, I'm Max,
I'm on my way to becoming a professional developer. I realized that I'm starting to lose track of all the little bits and pieces of knowledge necessary on this path and therefore decided to create this database. 
If you have corrections or suggestions, don't hesitate to create a pull request in the corresponding [github repo](https://github.com/3ng7n33r/KnowledgeBase)


Welcome to my personal knowledge base. This little project of mine was created in an attempt to get a better understanding of all the parts involved in the process of becoming a developer. 

Here I will collect what I deem to be the most useful bits of knowledge regarding the many different topics I encounter on my way to becoming a professional developer.
