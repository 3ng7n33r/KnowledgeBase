# Intro

Hi, I'm Max,
I'm a former mechanical engineer now on my way to becoming a professional developer. I realized that I'm starting to lose track of all the little bits and pieces of knowledge necessary on this path and therefore decided to create this database. It will be a personal collection of notes that might or might not make sense to anyone else but I thought I might as well make it public just in case someone could find it useful.

If you have corrections or suggestions, don't hesitate to create a pull request in the corresponding [GitHub repo](https://github.com/3ng7n33r/KnowledgeBase). 

If you would like to create a base like this yourself, shoot me a message and I'll happily guide you through the process (it's essentially an [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/summary.html), being built by a [GitHub action](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#getting-started), linked to a [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) Markdown editor, I'm working on writing a quick HowTo).

Best Regards!
P.s.: I will leave a Hemingway quote here which I found motivational:
"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man. True nobility is being superior to your former self"
