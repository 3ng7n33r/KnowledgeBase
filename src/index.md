# Intro

Hi, I'm Max,
I'm a former mechanical engineer now on my way to becoming a professional developer. I realized that I'm starting to lose track of all the little bits and pieces of knowledge necessary on this path and therefore decided to create this database. 
If you have corrections or suggestions, don't hesitate to create a pull request in the corresponding [GitHub repo](https://github.com/3ng7n33r/KnowledgeBase). 
If you would like to create a base like this yourself, shoot me a message and I'll happily guide you through the process (it's essentially an [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/summary.html), being build by a [GitHub action](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#getting-started), linked to a [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) Markdown editor, I'm working on writing a quick HowTo).

Best Regards!
