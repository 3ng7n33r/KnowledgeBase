Welcome to my personal knowledge base. This little project of mine was created in an attempt to get a better understanding of all the parts involved in the process of becoming a developer. 

Here I will collect what I deem to be the most useful bits of knowledge regarding the many different topics I encounter on my way to becoming a professional developer.
