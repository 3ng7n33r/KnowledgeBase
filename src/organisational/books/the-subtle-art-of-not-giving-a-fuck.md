# The subtle art of not giving a fuck - Mark Ronson

 - The desire for more positive experience is a negative experience. The acceptance of negative experiences is a positive experience
 - Solve problems - be happy!
 - Things that keep people from solving problems
	 - Denial - often assisted by self-help gurus that teach many different forms of denial
	 - Victim mentality - The believe that there is nothing that can be done to fix these problems
 - The older you get, the more experience you collect, the less significant each new experience affects you
	 - Experiences, even if repeated, fade (actually not in the book)
