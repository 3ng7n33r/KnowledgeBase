# The Death of Democracy - 

 - Fascism developed only in advanced democracies where the socialist left gad become succesful enough to frighten the middle classes. Fascism was in part a defensive reaction against the left by those who feared it the  most
 - Goebbels knew that the stormtroopers violence was a magnet for the press and although the Nazis provoked most of the violence, they always presented their own actions as defensive
 - In a particularly sharp observation he [Drucker] noted that Nazism had succeeded not because people believed it's message but in spite of the fact that they did not. Nazi successes had been witnessed by a hostile press ... which untiringly pointed out the Nazi lies the inconsistencies the unattainability of their promises and the folly of their course. 
 - Clearly nobody would have been a Nazi if rational belief in the Nazi promises had been a prerequisite.
 - The best explanation of Nazism that Drucker had ever witnessed came from a Nazi agitator whom many years ago he heard proclaim: "We don want lower, higher or unchanged bread prices. We want national socialist bread prices"
 - The result was that it was often those who had fought the hardest for the poor and underprivileged that were the most disillusioned about the democratic capability of ordinary people.
- Otto Braun remarked it was not the idea of democracy that had failed, it was a considerable portion of the german people who had not proven equal to the responsibility which suddenly lay on their shoulders
- Ernst Toller wrote: The people are tired of reason, tired of thought and reflection. They ask, what has reason done for us. What good are insight and knowledge.
