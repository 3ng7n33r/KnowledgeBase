# Licenses
The two main categories of open source licenses often require in-depth explanation. Open source licenses can be divided into two main categories: [copyleft](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/open-source-copyleft-licenses) and permissive. This division is based on the requirements and restrictions the license places on users.
## Copyleft vs. permissive
**Copyleft**

 - Allows to use, modify and share
 - Copyleft license has to be maintained

**Permissive**
- "Anything goes"
- permits proprietary derivative works

## Copyleft licenses
### GPL - Gnu general public license
The most popular open source license, created by Richard Stallman to protect GNU from becoming proprietary. More [here](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/open-source-licenses-explained#GNU%20General%20Public%20License).
