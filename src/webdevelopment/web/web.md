### Packet switching
In [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication "Telecommunication"), **packet switching** is a method of grouping [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing) "Data (computing)") that is transmitted over a digital [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network "Telecommunications network") into [packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet "Network packet"). Packets are made of a [header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(computing) "Header (computing)") and a [payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(computing) "Payload (computing)"). Data in the header is used by networking hardware to direct the packet to its destination, where the payload is extracted and used by [application software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software"). 
You can check your nodes along the way with either $ tracepath or $ traceroute6:
