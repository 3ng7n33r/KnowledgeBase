# URL
Uniform Resource Locators are the mechanism used by browsers to retrieve any published resource on the web.
A URL is composed of multiple parts, some mandatory, some optional. 

## Anatomy
```html
http://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html?key1=value1&key2=value2#SomewhereInTheDocument
```
### Protocol ("http")
Tells the browser which protocol to use. Most common are [http](https://3ng7n33r.github.io/KnowledgeBase/webdevelopment/web/http.html) and [https](https://3ng7n33r.github.io/KnowledgeBase/webdevelopment/web/https.html) but others like mailto and ftp are possible.
