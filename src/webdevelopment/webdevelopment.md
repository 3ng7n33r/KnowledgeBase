# Web development
I let Kamran Ahmeds web developer [roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) be my main guide in a structured learning approach. 

Therefore, my first website was a simple [tribute page](https://codepen.io/3ng7n33r/full/vYOVrXL) to french politician Aristide Briand in HTML with minimal CSS and no JavaScript.
    ![Tribute page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3ng7n33r/KnowledgeBase/master/src/static/20201122_tribute_page.png)
I am too curious about the whole process and am therefore alternating between the Front-End and Back-End path. I have since built more complex sites with more JavaScript code or built from a Front-End framework (VueJs). But also a web-scraper project built with Django and MySQL.
I will add  and describe these [projects](https://3ng7n33r.github.io/KnowledgeBase/webdevelopment/projects/projects.html) in the projects section of this website.
