# Design Guidelines

From [Don't make me think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think):

 - There is almost always a plausible rationale - and a good, if misguided intention - behind every usability flaw
- As a user, I should never have to devote a millisecond of thought to whether things are clickable or not.
- If you can't make something self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory
- We don't read pages. We scan them.
- Most of the time we don't choose the best option- we choose the first reasonable option
- Take advantage of conventions
- Create effective visual hierarchies
- Break up pages into clearly defined areas
- Make it obvious what's clickable
- Eliminate distractions
- Format content to support scanning
- Clarity trumps consistency
- The more important something is, the more prominent it is
- Things that are related logically are related visually
- Things are nested visually to show what's part of what
- Use plenty of headings and don't let them float
- Keep paragraphs short
- Use bulleted lists
- Happy talk must die
- Instructions must die
- Navigation should be on every site and in the same place except for forms
- All web users expect the side ID to be a home button
- every page should have a search box or a link to the search
- For Search boxes avoid:
	- Wording outside the norm (Quick Find instead of Search)
	- Instructions (no one cares)
	- Options (give it on the results page if the first shot didn't work)
- Give low level (3rd or 4th level) navigation the same attention
- The most common failing of you are her indicators is that they are too subtle
- Too subtle visual clues are a very common problems because subtlety is a trait of good design. Most users are too much in a rush to notice though
- Breadcrumbs are good for navigation:
	- At the top
	- with > in between and > **A bold last item**
- Try  the trunk test (page 62)
- The home page needs to answer 5 questions:
	- What is this?
	- What can I do here?
	- What do they have here?
	- Why should I be here and not somewhere else?
	- Where do I start?
- The antidote for religious debates (p. 77)
