# Design Guidelines

A summary of
 [Don't make me think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think):
- If you can't make something self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory
- Take advantage of conventions
- Create effective visual hierarchies
- Break up pages into clearly defined areas
- Make it obvious what's clickable
- Eliminate distractions
- Format content to support scanning
- Clarity trumps consistency
- The more important something is, the more prominent it is
- Things that are related logically are related visually
- Things are nested visually to show what's part of what
- Use plenty of headings and don't let them float
- Keep paragraphs short
- Use bulleted lists
- Happy talk must die
- Instructions must die
- Navigation should be on every site and in the same place except for forms
- All web users expect the side ID to be a home button
- every page should have a search box or a link to the search
- For Search boxes avoid:
	- Wording outside the norm (Quick Find instead of Search)
	- Instructions (no one cares)
	- Options (give it on the results page if the first shot didn't work)
- Give low level (3rd or 4th level) navigation the same attention
- The most common failing of "you are here" indicators is that they are too subtle
- Too subtle visual clues are a very common problems because subtlety is a trait of good design. Most users are too much in a rush to notice though
- Breadcrumbs are good for navigation:
	- At the top
	- with > in between and > **A bold last item**
- Try  the trunk test (page 62)
- The home page needs to answer 5 questions:
	- What is this?
	- What can I do here?
	- What do they have here?
	- Why should I be here and not somewhere else?
	- Where do I start?
- Don't use small-low contrast type
- Don't put labels inside form fields
- Preserve the distinction between visited and unvisited links
- Don't float headings in between paragraphs (have them closer to the text that follows than the one that precedes)

How we use websites:
- We don't read pages. We scan them.
- Most of the time we don't choose the best option- we choose the first reasonable option
- All web users expect the side ID to be a home button

Testing:
- The antidote for religious debates is testing
 - Every web development team should spend one morning a month doing usability testing
 - Use services like usertesting.com
 - Focus on fixing the most serious problem first

Mobile:

 - Allow zooming
 - Link to relevant pages, not to Homepages
 - Give an option to view the desktop version of the site
 - Make sure visual hints (affordances) don't get lost in the mobile version
 - Remember that speeds on mobile are unreliable (make mobile sites small)
 - Make it possible to change font size (Really?)
