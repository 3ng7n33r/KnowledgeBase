# Design Guidelines

From [Don't make me think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think):

 - There is almost always a plausible rationale - and a good, if misguided intention - behind every usability flaw
- As a user, I should never have to devote a millisecond of thought to whether things are clickable or not.
- If you can't make something self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory
- We don't read pages. We scan them.
- Most of the time we don't choose the best option- we choose the first reasonable option
- Take advantage of conventions
- Create effective visual hierarchies
- Break up pages into clearly defined areas
- Make it obvious what's clickable
- Eliminate distractions
- Format content to support scanning
- Clarity trumps consistency
- The more important something is, the more prominent it is
- Things that are related logically are related visually
- Things are nested visually to show what's part of what
- Use plenty of headings and don't let them float
- Keep paragraphs short
- Use bulleted lists
- Happy talk must die
- Instructions must die
