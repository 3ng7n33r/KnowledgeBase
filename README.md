Hi, I'm Max, I'm a former mechanical engineer now on my way to becoming a professional developer. I realized that I'm starting to lose track of all the little bits and pieces of knowledge necessary on this path and therefore decided to create this database. It will be a personal collection of notes that might or might not make sense to anyone else but I thought I might as well make it public just in case someone could find it useful.

If you have corrections or suggestions, don't hesitate to create a pull request in the corresponding GitHub repo.

If you would like to create a base like this yourself, shoot me a message and I'll happily guide you through the process (it's essentially an mdbook, being built by a GitHub action, linked to a StackEdit Markdown editor, I'm working on writing a quick HowTo).

Best Regards!
