<h2><a class="header" href="#meditation" id="meditation">Meditation</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Meditation is a simple practice available to all, which can reduce stress, increase calmness and clarity and promote happiness. Learning how to meditate is straightforward, and the benefits can come quickly. Even just a few minutes a day can make a big difference revealing and refactoring various <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WYmmC3W6ZNhEgAmWG/a-mechanistic-model-of-meditation#Uses_for_moments_of_introspective_awareness_">mental motions</a>.
<ul>
<li>If you have more introspective awareness of the exact processes that are happening in your mind, you can make more implicit assumptions conscious, causing your brain's built-in contradiction detector to notice when they contradict your later learning. Also, getting more feedback about what exactly is happening in your mind allows you to notice more wasted motion in general.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The goal of meditation is not to quit having thoughts, but to observe them, watch them without reacting and rationalizing them. This helps rewire the way your brain works similar to cognitive behavioral therapy. Typically, people who work towards this, have less anxiety and depression because they don't react to every thought they have, which gives them a greater control of their emotions.</li>
<li>Too many distractions lead to a heavy mind.</li>
<li>Meditating is controlling attention. Everything is downstream attention. Practice <a href="https://youtu.be/hQo-CQzoW24">mindfulness</a> to improve your attention and noticing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/how-to-meditate">How to Meditate</a>:
<ol>
<li>Find a comfortable place to sit, and a posture that is both alert and relaxed at the same time. See if you can make the spine erect, without being too rigid.</li>
<li>Close your eyes (or leave them slightly open if you prefer), and take a few slow breaths. Take a few moments to loosen your body from your head to your toes, and take a few more deep breaths. Scan your body to see if you can find any other tension that you can release.</li>
<li>Stop to notice the sensations throughout your body — the warmth, the coolness or any discomfort. Be aware of them, but try not to fidget too much.</li>
<li>Keep your attention on your breath. Your mind will wander. Notice it whenever it happens, congratulate yourself for having noticed it, and then return to the breath. After a few moments, your mind may wander again. Once again, notice that and simply return your attention back to the present moment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#journaling" id="journaling">Journaling</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Journaling is a &quot;keystone&quot; habit. It tightly locks all of your other habits in place.</li>
<li>It helps build a self evaluation loop in your life. It gives you the ability to discover what were you thinking and how the decisions turned out. If you don't reflect on your past, any improvements you do in the future will be by randomness.</li>
<li>When you are in an intensely emotional mood, journaling can help you more fully experience and understand those emotions.</li>
<li>Journal about things, people, or situations for which you are grateful. Consider including negative situations like avoiding an accident, for instance.</li>
<li>The development of a coherent narrative helps you reorganize and structure old memories, making them less traumatic.</li>
<li>Writing on a regular basis may allow for repeated exposure to your old memories, which will help you get rid of your negative emotional responses.</li>
<li>Premeditatio malorum. By imagining the worst case scenario ahead of time, you could overcome the fear of negative experiences and make better plans to prevent them.</li>
<li><a href="https://nesslabs.com/dear-diary">Journaling is a tool you can use to better manage your mental health</a>.</li>
<li>There are many methods. Start with a simple one like &quot;What worked, what didn't, what's next&quot;.</li>
<li>Weekly Review:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/">Review what happened during the week</a>. How did the week go? Write down a list of topics to think about and take written notes on each topic as you think about them.</li>
<li>Review a set of recurrent prompts. Tweak them over time. For example:
<ul>
<li>Consistency at your core habits this week (exercise, morning routine, todo system, etc.). How can you tweak them to be more consistent or more useful?</li>
<li>What did you do this week that was a mistake and how can I avoid repeating it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What would you like to accomplish next week?
<ul>
<li>Do you need to clarify something?</li>
<li>Which actions will you move closer to your goals?</li>

<h2><a class="header" href="#stoicism" id="stoicism">Stoicism</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.njlifehacks.com/what-is-stoicism-overview-definition-10-stoic-principles/">Stoicism is a tool set that helps us direct our thoughts and actions in an unpredictable world</a>.</li>
<li>We don't control and cannot rely on external events, but we can (to a certain extent) control our mind and choose our behavior.</li>
<li>It's not what happens to us but our reactions to it that matter.</li>
<li>The 3 Stoic principal leaders are Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca.</li>
<li>Stoicism teaches how to keep a calm and <a href="rationality.html">rational</a> mind no matter what happens to you and it helps you understand and focus on what you can control and not worry about and accept what you can't control.</li>
<li>We'd be crazy to want to face difficulty in life. But we'd be equally crazy to think that it isn't going to happen. Prepare for it and plan for the worst. The idea of premeditation of adversity is to repeatedly imagine potentially &quot;bad&quot; scenarios in advance, so that they will not catch you by surprise, and you'll be able to face them calmly and act according to virtue.</li>
<li>Stoic ideas inevitably lead to greater mindfulness.</li>
<li>Accept rather than fight every little thing.</li>
<li>Judge yourself accurately and honestly.</li>
<li>Causes (stress, overwhelm) are within us. Don't blame people or circumstances. You have a choice.</li>
</ul>
